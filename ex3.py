print("I will now count my chickens:") # It prints "I will now count my chickens:"

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6) #This one prints "Hens", than make a count as 25 + 30 / 6
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4) # This also prints that "Roosters" and than calculate how much is 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print("Now I will count the eggs:") # This just writes on the screen that "Now I will count the eggs:

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6) # This is a calculation here of 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7) # This prints the result of 3 + 2 < 5 - 7 as a Boolean

print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2) # This one prints "What is 3 + 2?" and count it, too

print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7) # This prints "What is 5 - 7?" and make this calculation after

print("Oh, that's why it's False.") # This just prints "Oh, that's why it's False."

print("How about some more.") # It makes also a printing process and writes "How about some more."

print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2) # Now we compare which is bigger: 5 or -2. This will also prints both the question and the result.
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= - 2) # This is very similar to the previous instruction
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2) # But this is the opposite now
